# PlaneSmith
PlaneSmith is a level editor for 2D games. It is general purpose, meaning it makes no further assumptions about the games you make.

One of its advantages is that it allows you to specify the format of the output of your levels.

You can download it from the releases section. Make sure to go through the documentation and examples to understand how to use it.
